        <h2>Maze projet </h2>
        <a href="https://github.com/ConnorNylund/CSC111-Maze-Project">MAZE</a>
        <p id="grad" class="paragraph">This project was a unique project focusing on the aspects of recursion 
            and having your code run throught the maze printing a "S" for the start 
            and "F" for the end, a "V" where the path Visits, and a "P" for the actual 
            path through the maze. This was a fun project to do because you could give 
            it any maze and have it print out the path throught the maze.</p>
        <h2>Sorting projet </h2>
        <a href="https://github.com/ConnorNylund/CSC111-Sorting-Project">SORTING</a>
        <p id="grad" class="paragraph">The sorting project was a good way to learn about some of the diffrent sorting 
            methods that there are the ones that we used were bubble sort, selection sort, 
            and merge sort. Each one that we used we had to keep track of the comparisons 
            that were made within each of the diffrent methods and the print out the results 
            of each method with a diffrent ammounts of array lengths.
